The objective of this project was to develop a predictive model capable of forecasting the score at the end of the first 6 overs in T20 cricket matches. The model was created as part of an academic competition and achieved a top 50 placement, winning a cash prize.

Key Features:-

Predictive Modeling: Developed a robust predictive model using Python to forecast the score at the end of the first 6 overs in T20 cricket matches.

Historical Data Analysis: Analyzed historical match data to identify patterns and key factors influencing the score.

Algorithm Development: Utilized Python programming skills to implement an accurate prediction algorithm.
